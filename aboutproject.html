      <h1>About Project For Everyone</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Project For Everyone (PFE)</strong> is a career development
        initiative designed to equip individuals with the tools, experience, and
        confidence they need to break into the workforce—no matter their
        background. At the heart of our mission is accessibility: we believe
        everyone deserves a chance to prepare for real-world roles in a
        supportive, inclusive, and practical environment.

      <h2 id="realistic-job-simulations">Realistic Job Simulations</h2>
      <p>
        We provide immersive <strong>job simulations</strong> that replicate
        real workplace challenges across various entry-level roles—ranging from
        business analysis and customer support to digital marketing, data, and
        tech. These simulations are structured to reflect day-to-day
        responsibilities, allowing users to gain hands-on experience, build
        confidence, and demonstrate their skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our in-house simulations are designed by career professionals and
        educators to mirror real tasks like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drafting emails or reports,</li>
        <li>Prioritizing tasks under deadlines,</li>
        <li>Making decisions based on real-time data, and</li>
        <li>Collaborating with (fictional) team members to solve problems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Partnered Scenarios with Employers</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond our internally developed experiences,
        <strong
          >Project For Everyone collaborates with clients and employers</strong
        >
        to create <strong>custom, branded job scenarios</strong>. These
        simulations reflect the exact tasks and expectations a candidate might
        face if they joined that company, giving users a unique preview of
        company culture and work style.
      </p>

      <p>For employers, this is a powerful way to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Educate prospective candidates,</li>
        <li>Reduce early-stage hiring friction, and</li>
        <li>
          Attract individuals with a demonstrated interest and relevant skills.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For users, it's a chance to experience what a role might truly feel like
        before applying.
